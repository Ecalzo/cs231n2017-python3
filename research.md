## To Research
* Rewatch analytic gradient calculation - look for supplementary materials
* Revisit finding the gradient for a two layer neural net
    * why do they subtract 1 from the softmax matrix??
    * can we check it by hand?
* Study backprop and analytic gradient until we're comfortable
* Review training and prediction steps of the NN
